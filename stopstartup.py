Stop most services from starting for a time

Some Debian package installs automatically launch an instance, and sometimes
you don't want that to happen immediately. `stopstartup`, when activated, will
stop any service started via invoke-rc.d from starting. It does this by
hijacking /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d, which invoke-rc.d calls for every service.
Normally the file should determine if your currently active "policy" (whatever
that means) should allow the service to startup. The policy enforcer installed
by `stopstartup` is much less nice, and simply rejects any request.
